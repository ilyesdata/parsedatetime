    0.7.2 release

31 Aug 2006 - bear

    Fixed two bugs found by Darshana today.

    The first is one of those forehead-slapping bugs that you see as
    being so obvious *after* the fact :)  The problem is with Inc()
    for months - if you increment from a month with the day set to
    a value that is past the end of the month for the new month you
    get an error.  For example Aug 31 to Sept - Sept doesn't have 31
    days so it's an invalid date.

    The second is with the code that identifies modifiers when you have
    multiple "chunks" of text.  Darshana describes the bug this way:

      "if you have "flight from SFO at 4pm" i.e. if you have a
       non-date/time string before a modifier, then the invalidflag
       is set"

    I provided the Inc() fix and Darshana the modifier fix.

    I also added a new unit test for the Inc() bug and also a new test
    file for the modifier bug: TestPhrases.py

    Updated ez_setup.py to latest version v0.6c1 and removed
    hard-coded version in setup.py for setuptools

    Moved the error tests into a single TestErrors.py
    Added two tests for days - it figures out what the
    previous day and next day is from the weekday the
    test is run on

    Issue #2 http://code.google.com/p/parsedatetime/issues/detail?id=2

    Turns out that ICU works with weekdays in Sun..Sat order
    and that Python uses Mon..Sun order.  Fixed PyICU locale code to
    build the internal weekday list to be Python Style.

    Bumping version to 0.7.1 as this is causing Chandler bug 6567
