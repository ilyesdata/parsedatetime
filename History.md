The code in parsedatetime has been implemented over the years in many
different languages (C, Clipper, Delphi) as part of different
custom/proprietary systems I've worked on.  Sadly the previous code is
not "open" in any sense of that word.

When I went to work for Open Source Applications Foundation and realized
that the Chandler project could benefit from my experience with parsing
of date/time text I decided to start from scratch and implement the
code using Python and make it truly open.

After working on the initial concept and creating something that could be
shown to the Chandler folks the code has now evolved to it's current state
with the help the Chandler folks, most especially Darshana.
