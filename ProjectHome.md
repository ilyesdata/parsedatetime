I'm moving the active code over to https://github.com/bear/parsedatetime

I will try and keep this up to date.



Current version 0.8.7

parsedatetime is able to parse, for example, the following:

  * August 25th, 2008
  * 25 Aug 2008
  * Aug 25 5pm
  * 5pm August 25
  * next saturday
  * tomorrow
  * next thursday at 4pm
  * at 4pm
  * eod
  * tomorrow eod
  * eod tuesday
  * eoy
  * eom
  * in 5 minutes
  * 5 minutes from now
  * 5 hours before now
  * 2 hours before noon
  * 2 days from tomorrow
