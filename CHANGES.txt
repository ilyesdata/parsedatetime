    0.7.3 release

13 Sep 2006 - bear

    Added Darshana as an author and updated the copyright text
    Added "eom" and "eoy" tests

11 Sep 2006 - bear

    Fixed a subtle dictionary reference bug in buildSources() that was causing
    any source related modifier to not honor the day, month or year.  It only
    started being seen as I was working on adding "eod" support as a 'true'
    modifier instead.

    Found another subtle bug in evalModifier() if the modifier was followed
    by the day of the week - the offset math was not consistent with the
    other day-of-week offset calculations.

    Worked on converting "eod" support from the special case modifier to work
    as a true modifier.

    The following is now supported:
        eod tomorrow
        tomorrow eod
        monday eod
        eod monday
        meeting eod
        eod meeting

    Added a sub-range test in response to Issue #6 http://code.google.com/p/parsedatetime/issues/detail?id=6

    Not that it works, just wanted to start the process.

    Alan Green filed Issue #5 http://code.google.com/p/parsedatetime/issues/detail?id=5

    In it he asked for support for Australian date formats "dd-mm-yyyy"

    This is the first attempt at supporting the parsing of dates where the order of the
    day, month and year can vary.  I adjusted the parseDate() code to be data driven
    and added a dp_order list to the Constants() class that is either initialized to the
    proper order by the pdtLocale classes or the order is determined by parsing the ICU
    short date format to figure out what the date separator is and then to find out what
    order it's in.

    I also added a TestAustralianLocale.py as a starting point for tests.

    Attaching a diff of this code to the Issue so he can test it.

    0.7.2 release

31 Aug 2006 - bear

    Fixed two bugs found by Darshana today.

    The first is one of those forehead-slapping bugs that you see as
    being so obvious *after* the fact :)  The problem is with Inc()
    for months - if you increment from a month with the day set to
    a value that is past the end of the month for the new month you
    get an error.  For example Aug 31 to Sept - Sept doesn't have 31
    days so it's an invalid date.

    The second is with the code that identifies modifiers when you have
    multiple "chunks" of text.  Darshana describes the bug this way:

      "if you have "flight from SFO at 4pm" i.e. if you have a
       non-date/time string before a modifier, then the invalidflag
       is set"

    I provided the Inc() fix and Darshana the modifier fix.

    I also added a new unit test for the Inc() bug and also a new test
    file for the modifier bug: TestPhrases.py

    Updated ez_setup.py to latest version v0.6c1 and removed
    hard-coded version in setup.py for setuptools

25 Aug 2006 - bear

    Moved the error tests into a single TestErrors.py
    Added two tests for days - it figures out what the
    previous day and next day is from the weekday the
    test is run on

    Issue #2 http://code.google.com/p/parsedatetime/issues/detail?id=2

    Turns out that ICU works with weekdays in Sun..Sat order
    and that Python uses Mon..Sun order.  Fixed PyICU locale code to
    build the internal weekday list to be Python Style.

    Bumping version to 0.7.1 as this is causing Chandler bug 6567
