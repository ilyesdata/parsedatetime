The generated documentation is included by default in the docs/
directory and can also be viewed online at

> http://code-bear.com/code/parsedatetime/docs/index.html

The docs can be generated (into the docs/ directory) using either
of the two commands:

> python setup.py doc
> epydoc --html --config epydoc.conf
